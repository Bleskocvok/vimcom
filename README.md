# vimcom

Just a simple vim comment plugin made to behave exactly how I want it to. If you want to use this for some reason, you can install it, but keep in mind it is unfinished.

## Usage

Press Ctrl+/ to comment/uncomment a line in normal/insert mode, or multiple lines selected in visual mode.

## Installation

```sh
cd ~/.vim/pack/vimcom
git clone https://github.com/Bleskocvok/vimcom.git
```

### Neovim
